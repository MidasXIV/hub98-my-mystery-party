        classification: "CONFIDENTIAL // INTERNAL USE ONLY",
        body: `Officer,

At 11:42 AM today, a male patient undergoing what was scheduled as a routine cardiac procedure at Saint Lazarus Hospital was declared dead on the operating table.

The lead surgeon was Dr. Alok Khanna — one of the city’s most respected cardiac surgeons, a man whose name is attached to hospital wings, medical conferences, and charitable trusts across West Bengal. This was supposed to be an uncomplicated operation. Instead, it ended with a fatal surgical error.

What makes this case sensitive is not just the death, but where it happened and who was involved.

Saint Lazarus is a private hospital with deep political and financial connections. Dr. Khanna’s wife sits on the hospital board. His son was present on the premises that morning. Several senior staff members, including another consultant surgeon, were recently in Goa with Dr. Khanna at a medical conference. Rumors, personal conflicts, and professional rivalries are already circulating within the hospital walls.

Initial observations suggest hesitation during a critical stage of the procedure. There are inconsistencies in medication handling, gaps in operating room timelines, and troubling discrepancies between witness accounts. Dr. Khanna insists the death was an unfortunate but unavoidable complication. Others are less certain.

No arrest has been made. No conclusion has been drawn.

You are being brought in to review all available material — interviews, medical records, digital logs, and personal accounts — and determine whether this was a tragic mistake, professional negligence, or something more deliberate.

Understand this clearly: pressure will come from all sides. The hospital wants this closed quickly. The family wants answers quietly. The public wants a name.

Ignore the noise. Follow the evidence.

Your job is to cut through this web of family honour, professional jealousy, and quiet desperation. Determine what truly happened in that operating theatre. Was it the simple mistake of a failing surgeon? Or was his hand guided by someone who wanted him to fail?

In my experience, in a place like Saint Lazarus, more secrets are buried than bodies. Go and dig.

— Inspector A. Dutta`,

In the last five months, since Goa, the frequency of your calls increased dramatically. Late nights, early mornings. It looks less like a rivalry and more like a conspiracy.",
          "Rao: (His composure is flawless) With his stress... Dr. Khanna began to confide in me. He sought my counsel. When the ship is in a storm, Inspector, you work to keep it from sinking. You don't argue about who is captain.",

A man like you, who knows the hospital's procedures intimately... it would be simple to arrange a 'mistake.' A switched vial, a contaminated saline drip.",
          "Rao: (Scoffs lightly) Do you seriously believe a senior surgeon would risk his entire life's work on such a crude, unpredictable gamble? It's illogical.",
          "Dutta: It is also illogical that Dr. Khanna's first phone call after the patient died was to you. Not his wife, not his son. You. Why?",
          "Rao: Because he was in professional shock. He needed a colleague who would understand the technical and emotional ramifications.",
          "Dutta: What did he say?",

          "Rao: I am his deputy, not his keeper! He was adamant. You have to understand the pressure he was under! The man was not sleeping... He called me two nights ago in a complete panic, saying he couldn't even remember the details of a procedure he'd pioneered. That's when Ajay— (He stops. It's almost imperceptible, a slight stammer.) ...that's when, I mean, Alok... Dr. Khanna said he felt he was losing his mind.",
          "Dutta: (Dutta doesn't flinch. He makes a small note on his pad, his expression unchanged, as if Rao had simply cleared his throat.) He told you he was losing his mind, and yet you still signed off on his surgical clearance. Is that standard procedure?",
          "Rao: (Relieved that the slip was seemingly ignored, he regains his footing.) My signature was a formality based on his physical assessment. I noted my concerns in a private memo. I did my duty.",
          "Dutta: I see. It seems everyone did their duty, and yet a man is dead. We will speak again, Doctor. I find that the smallest details, the ones we try to brush away, often tell the truest stories.",

          "Dutta: They say your influence grew after you went with him to that conference in Goa.",
          "Rosario: (Looks at him, genuinely confused) Goa? Sir, I have never been to Goa in my life.",
          "Dutta: Both Mrs. Khanna and her son were very clear. You accompanied the doctor.",
          "Rosario: They are mistaken. Or they are lying. The week of that conference, my mother had a fall in our family home in Asansol. I took one week's emergency leave to care for her. The hospital records will show it. The train tickets are in my name. My neighbours, my relatives in Asansol... they all saw me there.",
          "Dutta: (Pauses, making a note. The first crack in the family's story.) I see. Let's talk about your 'professional' relationship. My team checked the phone records. For a woman supposedly having a deep affair, your calls with Dr. Khanna have almost stopped in the last five months. You used to speak daily. Now, it's once or twice a week, and only for a minute. Explain that.",
          "Rosario: (Her expression softens with sadness) He stopped taking my calls, Sir. After he came back from Goa, he changed. He wouldn't listen to my pre-op briefings. He became distant, angry. He... he wasn't the same surgeon. I tried to speak to him, to understand, but he shut me out completely.",
          "Dutta: So you are saying he pushed you away.",
          "Rosario: Yes. It was like he didn't trust me anymore. Or maybe... he didn't trust himself.",
          "Dutta: Let's go to the operating theatre today. You were in the room. You handed him the instruments. You managed the medication. A small slip, a wrong vial... it all passes through your hands.",
          "Rosario: My hands are the most disciplined thing in my life, Sir. I have done this procedure with him over two hundred times. I know it backwards.",
          "Dutta: Then what happened?",
          "Rosario: He hesitated. During the bypass, there's a critical moment. He just... froze. His hands were shaking. I had never seen his hands shake before. The patient's pressure began to drop. I called out the readings. Once, twice. He wasn't responding. He was just staring.",
          "Dutta: What did you do?",
          "Rosario: I broke protocol. I started giving orders. I pushed the norepinephrine myself to stabilize the pressure, I called for the defibrillator paddles. I fought, Sir. I did everything I could to save that man while Dr. Khanna stood there like a ghost.",
          "Dutta: A very different story from the one I've been hearing. Nurse, a man is dead. Dr. Khanna is ruined. If it wasn't you who wanted this, and it wasn't the doctor's simple mistake... then who sabotaged this operation?",
          "Rosario: (Takes a deep breath, her decision made) Sabotage... is a strong word, Sir. But if you are asking who would benefit from Dr. Khanna failing... who has been acting strangely around him... it is Dr. Vikram Rao.",
          "Dutta: The rival. You've noticed their new 'friendship' too.",
          "Rosario: Friendship? Sir, for twenty years those two men barely spoke a civil word to each other. They were oil and water. After Goa, suddenly they are inseparable. Whispering in corridors. Closed-door meetings. Dr. Vikram, who always questioned Dr. Khanna's every move, suddenly started agreeing with him, encouraging him. He told Dr. Khanna he could handle this surgery, that it would be a great comeback.",
          "Dutta: He encouraged him?",
          "Rosario: Yes. He filled his head with confidence, when what Dr. Khanna needed was for someone to tell him to stop. Dr. Vikram knew he was not fit. He saw it. We all saw it.",
          "Dutta: Why would he do that?",
          "Rosario: Why does any man want power? With Dr. Khanna gone, the entire surgical wing, the board seat, the fame... it all goes to him. He didn't need to hold the knife, Sir. He just needed to make sure the man holding it was set up to fail.",
          "Dutta: One last question. After the patient died, Dr. Khanna made one phone call before he collapsed. Do you know who it was to?",
          "Rosario: I do, Sir. I was there. He didn't call his wife, or his son. He called Dr. Vikram. And the only thing I heard him say was, 'It happened. It's done.' That's when I knew this was more than a mistake.",

          "Dr. Alok Khanna arriving at Saint Lazarus Hospital earlier this year. The veteran surgeon has been suspended pending inquiry.",
        body: `One of Kolkata’s most prestigious private hospitals has been rocked by controversy following the death of a patient during what was described as a routine cardiac procedure, triggering a cascade of suspensions and an abrupt change in leadership.

Dr. Alok Khanna, a celebrated cardiac surgeon whose career spans over three decades, was suspended late Thursday evening after a preliminary internal review flagged “serious procedural irregularities” during the operation. Hospital authorities confirmed that the patient suffered fatal complications on the operating table despite no prior indication of elevated risk.

In a dramatic development, Dr. Vikram Rao, previously a senior consultant under Dr. Khanna, has been appointed Acting Head of the Cardiac Surgery Department with immediate effect. The hospital has not clarified whether this appointment is temporary or part of a longer restructuring.

Also suspended is Head Surgical Nurse Agnes Rosario, who assisted during the procedure. While hospital sources insist the move is “administrative,” multiple staff members, speaking on condition of anonymity, described a tense atmosphere inside the operating theatre in the days leading up to the surgery.

Adding to the turmoil, Nandini Khanna, Dr. Khanna’s wife and a sitting member of the hospital’s governing board, is reportedly facing pressure to step aside from board-related decisions connected to the inquiry. Questions have been raised about governance, oversight, and potential conflicts of interest within the hospital’s senior leadership.

What began as a medical tragedy has quickly escalated into a broader institutional crisis. Rumors of internal rifts, personal relationships influencing professional conduct, and disputes over departmental control have spread rapidly among staff and within medical circles.

Neither Dr. Khanna nor Saint Lazarus Hospital has issued a detailed public statement beyond confirming that a police inquiry is ongoing. Kolkata Police sources declined to comment on whether criminal negligence or deliberate wrongdoing is being considered.

For now, the hospital that once symbolized elite medical care finds itself under an unforgiving spotlight — as patients, doctors, and the public wait to learn whether this was a tragic error, or something far more unsettling.`,

Electronic devices, medical documents, and financial records were seized for forensic examination.\n\nThe raids come just two days after Dr. Vikram Rao was appointed interim head of the department, following the suspension of Dr. Khanna and administrative action against hospital director Mr. Agnes Rosario. Sources say investigators are now examining whether the events leading up to the patient’s death were the result of isolated negligence or a broader pattern of coordinated malpractice.\n\nPolice confirmed that the homes of Dr. Khanna’s immediate family were searched as part of a routine expansion of the inquiry. 'At this stage, no one connected to the case can be ruled out,' a senior officer said, adding that the investigation was 'not limited to the hospital premises alone.'\n\nLegal experts note that such wide-ranging searches are rare in medical negligence cases, indicating that authorities may be pursuing angles beyond clinical error. Hospital sources, meanwhile, report growing unease among staff, with several employees seeking legal counsel.\n\nSaint Lazarus Hospital has declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation. Public confidence in the institution continues to erode as questions mount over accountability, oversight, and the integrity of internal records.",

Cancelling his high-profile surgical rotation now, especially with the international investors watching, would send a catastrophic message.\n\nLet's not create a problem where one doesn't exist.
