        body: `Investigator,

You have been assigned to look into the incident involving Anita Break, the lead actress in this year's production of 'The Gilded Mirror.' Anita was found unconscious in the backstage prop storage room yesterday evening. 

Our initial search has narrowed the timeline of the attack to between 7:30 PM and 8:30 PM, shortly after the final dress rehearsal ended. During this window, only three individuals were recorded in the Drama Wing. Because the school recently installed electronic hall pass readers on all doors. 
The digital logs are going to be your best friend on this one.\n\nNow, here’s the kicker: While Anita was off in dreamland, her understudy had to step in for opening night and apparently delivered a performance for the ages. The play was a massive, sold-out success. Go figure.

We have secured the following evidence for your review:
- Electronic Hall Pass Logs.
- A School Memo from Principal Miller regarding protocol changes.
- Interview transcripts with key witnesses and suspect.
- Photos of evidences and persons of interest.
- Campus map highlighting relevant locations.

Your objectives are to determine the truth behind the  and identify the person responsible for orchestrating the sabotage before opening night.

Do not let the drama distract you from the facts.`,

          "Justin: That’s right. I went to her dressing room to discuss some vital 'creative subtext' for Scene 4. I felt my character’s motivation was being overshadowed by... well, by everything Her Leadness does.",
          "Officer: Did you speak with her?",
          "Justin: Sadly, no. I ran into Ray Dee-O, the tech guy, outside the prop wing. He told me that Her Leadness was having a 'pre-show crisis' because the organic glitter for her cape wasn't the right shade of 'sunset orange.' He said she was locked in her room and refused to come out until the world apologized to her.",
          "Officer: How has Anita’s behavior been during the rehearsals?",
          "Justin: Honestly, it’s been a total 'train wreck'-and not the artistic kind. Her demands for princess treatment have put a massive strain on the rehearsal schedule. We’re three days behind because she insisted on rehearsing her curtain call for four hours.",
          "Officer: Where were you between 7:30 PM and 8:30 PM tonight?",
          "Justin: I was in the green room, obviously. I was practicing my 'surprise face' for when Her Leadness inevitably forgot her lines and I had to save the show. I didn't leave my chair once.",
          "Officer: Did you notice any other conflicts today?",
          "Justin: Oh, it was a 'Barry-cade' of drama. Her Leadness was screaming at Cora Grapher because the choreography was 'too athletic' for her. Then she had a meltdown at Ray because the prop scepter wasn't 'shiny enough.' Even Principal Barry Cade looked like he was about to pop a gasket. He kept complaining about how much the theater lights were costing compared to the football field’s new stadium seating.",
          "Officer: And what did you do after Ray told you Anita was busy?",
          "Justin: I went back to my dressing room to practice my lines. I’m very dedicated, you know. I was focused on my craft.",

          "Justin: Not a peep! Everything seemed perfectly 'normal'—well, as normal as it gets when you’re working with a diva. I was so focused on my work that I didn't hear a single disturbance until Cora started screaming that the show was ruined.",

It has come to my attention that some of our extracurriculars are becoming quite... drama-tic in their spending. \n\nTo ensure we aren't just 'throwing a Hail Mary' with our finances, I am implementing the 'Performance Integrity Protocol.' Effective immediately: If any club fails to deliver their primary scheduled event (due to 'stage fright,' 'technical fumbles,' or 'opening night jitters'), their entire annual grant will be immediately forfeited.\n\nThese funds will be moved to the General Contingency Fund—which, strictly by coincidence, is currently reviewing a request for new gold-plated Gatorade buckets for our beloved Oakwood Ball-Hogs. Go Hogs!\n\nI don't want to have to 'Barry-cade' the door on your budgets, so please ensure your 'Final Rehearsal' goes off without a hitch. In this school, there are no understudies for success. Either the show goes on, or the funding moves on.\n\nLet's avoid any 'fumbles' this weekend!\n\nStay Golden,\n\nPrincipal Barry Cade",

          "Officer: We'll fix the lights later. The incident?",
          "Anita Break: Right. So, I was backstage serving looks and drinking this 'Mega-Matcha-Detox-Vibe' juice but it tasted like a lawnmower, three sips in and my brain just... stopped. Suddenly, the theater started spinning like a glitchy TikTok filter. I tried walking towards the washroom, but my legs felt like jelly. Total weak-sauce. I must have made it to the hallway before I blacked out.",
          "Officer: Did anyone give you that drink?",
          "Anita Break: I don't know, it was just... there? like... Justin was hovering around earlier, being an understudy-stalker as usual. He tried to talk to me, but I don't speak to people who don't have lead roles. It’s a boundary I have.",
          "Officer: Did you see Ray Dee-O, around that time?",
          "Anita Break: Ugh, Ray. He is low-key obsessed with me, it’s actually cringe. He keeps offering to 'optimize my lighting' and asking if I want to 'duo' in some game. I told him 'I play to win at life, Ray,' but he just stared at me with those giant headphones on. He has the master fobs, too. Super sus.",
          "Officer: You think Ray followed you?",
          "Anita Break: Probably! He thinks we're a 'power couple' in his delulu brain. He’s always bragging about how he can 'unlock the secrets of the theater.' Like, okay? Unlock some deodorant first, bestie.",

She’s been staring at the backup dancers with 'star-eyes' all week. I think she wants to replace me with someone who doesn't 'demand a private humidity-controlled fan.'",
          "Officer: After you felt dizzy, what happened?",
          "Anita Break: Everything went into 'sleep-mode.' But then I felt like I was floating. I literally thought I was being carried by a giant, blue, fuzzy Squishmallow. It was actually kind of cozy, but also super weird.",
          "Officer: A blue fuzzy thing? Are you sure?",
          "Anita Break: Yes! A giant blue fuzzy cloud. I thought I’d finally made it to the VIP section of heaven. But this cloud was really sweaty. And it smelled like... you know that smell when the gym teachers haven't washed the mats since 1998? Like rubber and old sweat? It was grody.",
          "Officer: Did this 'cloud' say anything?",
          "Anita Break: It was muttering. Something about 'money' and 'yard lines.' I thought it was a poem. You know, like, 'Grass is green, money is too, I’m a blue bear, how about you?' I was too tired to leave a review.",
          "Officer: Are you sure it was a bear?",
          "Anita Break: Maybe? All I know is this fuzzy blue guy bumped me into the doorframe. I tried to say 'Watch the hair!' but I just made a weird burping sound and fell back asleep.",
          "Anita Break: It was fuzzy! And blue! And it had these giant paws. One of the paws touched my face and left a streak of... I don't know, forbidden yellow glitter? It was very dusty and completely ruined my contour.",
          "Officer: Yellow dust. And then you were in the Vault?",
          "Anita Break: I woke up surrounded by old armor and medieval capes. I tried to use a knight’s helmet as a pillow but it was too cold. I didn't even realize I was locked in until the Principal started yelling outside.",
          "Officer: Principal Barry Cade? What was he doing?",
          "Anita Break: He was 'checking on me' or whatever. He seemed really stressed about the theater budget. He kept saying, 'This is a fumble! A total fumble!' He’s so obsessed with football, it’s actually a personality flaw. Like, get a hobby, Barry.",
          "Officer: Anita, this 'blue cloud'... could it have been the school mascot?",
          "Anita Break: A mascot? At a theater rehearsal? That is literally so 'low-budget' it’s offensive. Why would a mascot be in the Prop Vault? They don't even have lines! They’re basically just NPCs in fur suits.",
          "Officer: We're looking into it. Go get some rest.",
          "Anita Break: Fine. But tell Cora if she replaces me with a mid understudy, I’m taking my 4.5 GPA and moving to the rival high school. They have better lighting and a way better Starbucks nearby anyway. Peace out!",
