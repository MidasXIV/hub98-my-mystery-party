Starting strong matters. Use this simple rubric to choose a case that fits your group—and guarantees a great night.

> Picking the right case maximizes fun and minimizes confusion.

## Group size and energy
For 6–10 players, pick premade cases with flexible roles. For larger groups, choose modular clue packs.

## Difficulty vs. fun
Beginner‑friendly cases use clear contradictions and minimal cipher decoding. Avoid heavy logic gates for first events.

## Theme resonance
Match the group’s vibe: academia, crime caper, cozy mystery, sci‑fi station.

## Time box
Aim for 90–120 minutes with two breaks. Keep the reveal to five minutes.
