## Why Our Evidence Feels Different

We’ve crafted varied, story‑rich artifacts that fit together like puzzle pieces—each type reveals something others miss. The goal isn’t just to read files, but to assemble truth from context.

## Diary Entries

Personal notes, private thoughts, and unguarded reactions. Use them to:
- Catch emotional cues that don’t appear in formal statements.
- Track inconsistencies in tone over time.
- Establish the writer’s routine and habits.

## Interrogation Transcripts

Verbatim records with hesitations, deflections, and corrections. Ask for:
- Quote extraction to capture exact wording.
- Contradictions versus receipts and messages.
- Summary of inconsistencies across all interviews.

## Electronic Messages

Emails and chat fragments that reveal relationships, coordination, or friction. Try:
- Timeline alignment between messages and sightings.
- Keyword searches (names, places, times).
- Tone analysis: supportive, hostile, evasive.

## Receipts & Financial Records

Hard anchors for time and place. Use them to:
- Validate or debunk alibis.
- Connect purchases to motives or opportunity.
- Spot patterns across multiple receipts.

## Maps & Location Notes

Spatial context for movements and claims. Ask for:
- Plausibility checks: could someone travel that route in time?
- Cross‑reference with sightings and messages.
- Visual summary of key locations.

## Putting It Together

The magic happens when you cross‑reference:
- Diary ↔ Messages: what people say vs. what they confide.
- Transcripts ↔ Receipts: spoken claims vs. records.
- Maps ↔ Timeline: where vs. when.

## Example Objectives Powered by Evidence

- Verify Casey’s alibi using receipts and transcripts.
- Identify contradictions between Alex’s diary entries and messages.
- Build a map‑based timeline of movements on the day of the incident.

## Final Tip

Ask in plain English. The assistant will pull quotes, summaries, and contradictions across evidence so you can focus on reasoning—not busywork.
