## Why Natural Language Matters

Our platform understands everyday instructions. Instead of memorizing commands, you can ask for summaries, comparisons, timelines, contradictions, or suggestions—like a real investigative partner.

## Core Patterns That Work

### Summarize
- "Summarize the diary entries from the first week."
- "Give me the key points from Casey’s interrogation."

### Compare
- "Compare the June 10 diary entry with the chat messages from June 10."
- "Do the receipt times match the claimed alibi?"

### Find contradictions
- "Highlight any contradictions between the transcript and the receipt."
- "Call out statements that conflict with the map notes."

### Suggest next steps
- "Which objective should I tackle next based on what I’ve opened?"
- "Point me to the most relevant evidence for the alibi objective."

## Objective‑First Workflow

1. Open the Objectives panel.
2. Pick one objective—stay focused until it’s resolved.
3. Use summaries and comparisons to quickly orient.
4. Ask for contradictions to validate or debunk claims.
5. Mark the objective complete and move to the next.

## Cross‑Referencing Evidence

Use natural language to weave together different artifact types:
- Diary entries ↔ electronic messages (timing, tone, contradictions)
- Interrogation transcripts ↔ receipts (facts vs. records)
- Maps ↔ sightings ↔ timelines (movement plausibility)

## Tips to Work Smarter

- Anchor by time: ask for a day-by-day timeline to spot gaps.
- Leverage quotes: request verbatim excerpts when precision matters.
- Re‑ask differently: if an answer’s vague, restate the question with exact names, dates, and evidence types.

## Example Prompts You Can Copy

- "Summarize all evidence that supports Casey’s alibi on Friday between 7–9 PM."
- "List contradictions between Alex’s interrogation and any receipts mentioning the diner."
- "Give me a short action plan to complete the ‘verify alibi’ objective."

## When New Evidence Unlocks

If the case reveals new items, request an update:
- "What’s new since my last objective was completed?"
- "Summarize newly added evidence and how it impacts open objectives."

## Wrap‑Up

Plain English is enough. Keep your questions focused on the current objective, and let the assistant do the busywork of reading across diary entries, transcripts, messages, receipts, and maps.
