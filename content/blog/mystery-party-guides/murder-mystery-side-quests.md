## Why Side Quests Work

Side quests give guests alternate ways to contribute, spread attention across the room, and create satisfying micro‑reveals that support the main mystery.

- Lower pressure: perfect for shy or first‑time players.
- Parallel discovery: while key evidence unlocks, players can tackle mini‑puzzles.
- Reward momentum: solves can grant hints, currency (tokens), or access to a new clue.

## Design Principles

- Keep each quest self‑contained and completable in 5–10 minutes.
- Tie outcomes to suspects, timelines, or motives—never just trivia.
- Offer 2–3 difficulty levels so different players can contribute.

## Quest Ideas You Can Drop In

1. **Cipher Note**: a short monoalphabetic cipher revealing a time or place.
2. **Map Route**: trace a plausible path in the city; shortest realistic path wins.
3. **Receipt Concordance**: reconcile timestamps across purchases; find the inconsistency.
4. **Photo Tagging**: identify items in a crime scene image and connect them to suspects.
5. **Audio Snippet**: transcribe a short voicemail; catch the odd phrasing or background sound.

## Rewards & Integration

- Grant a hint card or permission to inspect a locked evidence file.
- Provide suspect alibi contradictions as “rewards.”
- Award tokens redeemable for a late‑game clue or accusation priority.

## Digital Play Tips

- Keep side quest artifacts accessible in your case link: PDFs, images, maps.
- Use natural language prompts to summarize findings and spot contradictions.
- Record completions in an objectives panel; celebrate with quick shout‑outs.

## Keep It Balanced

Avoid over‑stuffing: 3–5 side quests is plenty for most groups. Ensure each quest’s payoff nudges the main investigation forward and doesn’t overshadow the final reveal.

With a handful of well‑placed side quests, your mystery gains texture, your guests feel included, and the final reveal lands even better.
