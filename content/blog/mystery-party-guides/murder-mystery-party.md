## 📄 Murder Mystery Party (`mystery/`)

*by Trevor Hopkins*

For our son Sebastian’s 11th birthday party, Tracey and I decided to organise a Murder Mystery party. This was rather more work than we had anticipated to get the story and characters sorted out. Even so, it turned out to be a considerable success; the kids absolutely loved it! So, I have included below the plot and all the source materials I used, so that you can re-use or re-write it for your own games and parties. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

Normally, these Murder Mystery parties are for adults, and so rely on the guests reacting spontaneously (and in character) as the events unfold. This party was for 10-to-12 year olds, so I thought it best to script the entire event. We found this party is suitable for children who are old enough to read aloud reasonably well, but young enough to enjoy a certain amount of shouting and running around. I also took care to make the plot comprehensible (mostly!) to all, and to avoid certain adult themes which might confuse the kids or upset their parents. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

Since Sebastian’s birthday (which is now more than twelve years ago!) I have had a considerable number of people (now more than 10,000!) contact me by email at `thopk46@hotmail.com` to express an interest in using this material for their own parties. So, I have made this Murder Mystery Party free to use for anyone who wishes to do so — just drop me a note to get the easily updateable versions. There’s no need for any payment, although I have suggested to correspondents who asked that they might care to make a modest contribution to an appropriate charity of their choice.

I also see that many people have used these materials as the basis for adult parties, or with mixed groups of adults and children. Of course, I would be delighted to hear of other (hopefully) successful events based on this material. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

## 📨 Invitations

The process starts with the party invitations. Each invitation has to be separately devised and printed, since it introduces the character that each child is supposed to adopt for the party — one of the reasons why the event was so much work! The invitations need to be sent out in good time, to give both parents and children a chance to think about the character, as well as what clothes to wear. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

Some additional suggestions for parents and children to help can be found here — I included a copy of this with each invitation.

> It’s quite important to know exactly who is, and who is not, able to attend the party, since I found it necessary to adjust the plot and character list to accommodate missing guests. Apparently, the invitations themselves caused quite a stir at school. Some of the kids started referring to each other by their party character names! ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

## 🎭 Running the Party

It is important to ensure that **all guests have arrived** before the formal proceedings start. When each guest arrives they are given:

* A **personalised instruction sheet** folded into three (use stiff paper or thin card) and sealed with wax.
* A **name sticker** for their character.

While guests are arriving, they are served drinks (non-alcoholic for kids). Once everyone has arrived, they are instructed to sit quietly and open/ read their instruction sheets. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

The Master of Ceremonies was **Freddie Farr, Barrister-at-Law** (played by Trevor). Tracey played **Pinky Beasts**, local music teacher and mother to Ian Beasts (Sebastian — the name is an anagram!). Detective Inspector Herring (bumbling local policeman) was played by Sebastian’s Grandad. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

Each guest is introduced, reads their character instructions, and a short character-specific music clip is played. After all introductions, the guests play a scripted “investigation” game — asking and answering questions to gather clues. ([trevor-hopkins.com][1])

After tea, everyone re-assembles and Freddie reads through the **plot** (a spreadsheet) with parts marked “All” for communal interaction. Eventually, Pinky Beasts is revealed as the murderer and is arrested, and **Ian Beasts** is declared heir to the Baroness’s estate, ensuring there are party bags for all guests.
