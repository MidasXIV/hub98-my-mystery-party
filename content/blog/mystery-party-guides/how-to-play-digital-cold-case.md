## Overview

Our digital cold case is a guided, story-rich investigation you can play right in your browser. You’ll read case files, sift through evidence, and use natural language to ask questions and solve objectives—no special commands required.

## Quick Start

1. Browse cases here: [/cases](/cases)
2. Choose a case and press "Begin Investigation".
3. Read the case briefing, then open the Objectives panel.
4. Start chatting in plain English—ask the system to help you locate clues or summarize evidence.

## Key UI Panels

### Case Briefing
A concise overview of the victim, suspects, known timeline, and critical facts.

### Objectives
Your mission checklist. Each objective is written in plain language—complete them in any order. Examples:
- Verify a suspect’s alibi for a specific timeframe.
- Cross-check diary entries with electronic messages.
- Identify contradictions in interrogation transcripts.

### Evidence
All the investigative artifacts in one place, including:
- Diary entries and private notes
- Interrogation transcripts
- Electronic messages (email, chat snippets)
- Receipts and financial records
- Newspaper clippings
- Maps and location notes

## Use Natural Language to Solve Objectives

You can simply type what you need:

- "Summarize the main points from the interrogation of Alex."
- "Compare the diary entry on June 10 with the chat logs from the same day—any conflicts?"
- "Show me evidence that contradicts Casey’s alibi between 7–9 PM."

The assistant will reference the case files you’ve opened and guide you to the right documents.

## Adding More Evidence as You Progress

Some cases unlock new evidence items after you complete certain objectives. Watch for:

- Newly revealed diary pages
- Follow-up interrogation excerpts
- Fresh electronic messages

When new items appear, re-check your objectives—clues often combine across sources.

## Tips for Faster Progress

- Work objective-first: open the Objectives panel and focus on one goal at a time.
- Summarize often: use quick summaries to orient yourself after new reveals.
- Cross-reference: diary entries, messages, and receipts frequently corroborate or expose contradictions.
- Keep an eye on timestamps: small timing differences can be critical.

## FAQs

### Do I need special commands?
No. Natural language is enough. Just ask for what you need in plain English.

### Can I play with friends?
Yes—share the case page and collaborate. Compare notes and divide objectives.

### Does the system remember what I’ve found?
Your session tracks opened artifacts and completed objectives. You can pick up right where you left off.

## Ready to investigate?
