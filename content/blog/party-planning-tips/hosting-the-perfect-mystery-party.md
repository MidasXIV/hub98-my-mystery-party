## Start with a Theme and a Vibe

Pick a case or theme that matches your crowd—retro, cozy whodunit, or high-stakes noir. Match decor, invites, and music to set the tone.

## Guest Roles and Invites

- Share short character briefs and optional costume ideas.
- Send invites 2–3 weeks ahead.
- Include a simple "how the game works" note.

## Pacing the Night

Aim for three acts:
1. Welcome, introductions, and the case briefing.
2. Evidence exploration and light challenges.
3. Final reveals and celebratory wrap-up.

## Interactive Moments

- Photo wall or "case board" for clues.
- Mini-challenges: decode a note, trace a route on a map.
- Award fun titles (Best Sleuth, Most Dramatic Quote).

## Food & Drink

Keep it easy: finger foods, a signature mocktail/cocktail, and water stations. Label items with theme names ("Detective’s Delight").

## Using Our Digital Platform

If you host online or hybrid:
- Share the case link and let players open evidence live.
- Use natural language to request summaries and contradictions.
- Track objectives together and celebrate each completion.

## Final Checklist

- Theme + invites sent
- Character briefs shared
- Case briefing printed or bookmarked
- Evidence props ready
- Snacks and drinks prepped
- Awards or prizes ready
