## Prep the Space

- Lighting: string lights, lanterns.
- Comfort: blankets, cushions, warm layers.
- Sound: clear, low-volume background music.

## Portable Props

- Clipboards, pens, sticky notes.
- Printable maps and timelines.
- A small "evidence box" for reveal moments.

## Keep It Flowing

- Use short acts with breaks.
- Ask for summaries and contradictions via natural language.
- Take a group photo at the end.
