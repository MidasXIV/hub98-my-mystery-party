## Set the Tone with a Clear Theme

Pick a case or era that fits your group (cozy manor, noir city, retro heist). Use a short mood board to align decor, music, and invites.

- Decor: warm lights, framed “case files,” index cards with clue tags.
- Music: ambient jazz, rainy city soundscapes, or string quartets.
- Invites: send 2–3 weeks ahead with character blurbs and optional costume ideas.

## Roles, Briefs, and Props

- Share simple character briefs (1–2 short paragraphs) with motivations and relationships.
- Prepare 3–5 prop “evidence” pieces players can handle: a receipt, a map, a photo, a note.
- If hosting hybrid/online, place digital versions in your case link for quick access.

## Pacing the Night (3 Acts)

1. Welcome & Briefing: intro the scene and stakes; distribute roles.
2. Exploration: unlock evidence gradually and encourage side conversations.
3. Reveal & Debrief: gather for final accusations and the closing twist.

Keep acts to ~30–40 minutes and add short breaks.

## Side Quests: Engaging Optional Challenges

- Decode a cipher found in a letter.
- Match footprints on the “garden path” to a suspect.
- Cross‑reference a receipt with a map route.
- Find contradictions in electronic messages.

Side quests let quieter guests contribute and give energetic players extra discovery paths.

## Food & Drink that Supports Flow

Choose grazing boards, small plates, a signature mocktail/cocktail, and water stations. Label items with themed names (“Detective’s Delight,” “Suspect Snack”).

## Using Our Digital Platform

- Share your case link so guests can open evidence in real time.
- Ask natural language questions to summarize clues and spot contradictions.
- Track objectives together; celebrate each completion.

## Final Hosting Checklist

- Theme & invites prepared
- Character briefs printed or shared digitally
- Evidence props ready (physical + digital)
- Side quests prepared for optional engagement
- Snacks & drinks set
- Awards for standout sleuths

Happy hosting! With clear pacing and a few delightful side quests, your mystery party will be one to remember.
