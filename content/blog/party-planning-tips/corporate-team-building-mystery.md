## Why It Works

Mysteries promote communication, critical thinking, and playful collaboration—perfect for offsites or Friday socials.

## Setup Ideas

- Mixed-role teams (investigator, archivist, presenter).
- Short sprints around objectives.
- End with group insights and shout-outs.

## Using the Platform

- Natural language queries enable fast summaries and comparisons.
- Everyone can open evidence simultaneously.
- Objectives help structure work and celebrate progress.

## Debrief Questions

- Where did we communicate well?
- Which clue unlocked progress?
- What would we try differently next time?
